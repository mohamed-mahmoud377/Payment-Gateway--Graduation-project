#### HashCash is a gradation project which aims to build a [payment gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_gateway) for small merchants to start accepting payment really easy throw API integration without worrying about any [PCI](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) requirements and merchant account details.
#### We are focusing on implementing the actual service and APIs the merchant is going to use and the PCI requirements that comes with it not focusing on the system as a whole.
## how did we build it ?
#### we are using event driven microservices architecture
