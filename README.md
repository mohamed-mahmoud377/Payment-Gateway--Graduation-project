#### HashCash is a gradation project which aims to build a [payment gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_gateway) for small merchants to start accepting payment really easy throw API integration without worrying about any [PCI](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) requirements and merchant account details.
#### We are focusing on implementing the actual service and APIs the merchant is going to use and the PCI requirements that comes with it not focusing on the system as a whole.
## How did we build it ?
#### We are using event driven microservices' architecture. 
## our technology stack:
- Typescript as the main languages for all backend services
- Express framework to handle http requests in the backend
- MongoDB for database and mongoose for ODM
- Nats streaming server as event bus and message queue -a little outdated but for our learning purposes it get the job done just like kafka for example-
